**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Note**
Originally Forked from Khelldons [original 7d2dModlets for alpha17](https://github.com/Khelldon/7d2dModlets), then moved into this repo during a19

Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, Khelldon gave permission to use/update these as needed, per https://7daystodie.com personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date and close to original purpose/functionality as much as I reasonably can.

**To install game mods**: [7 Days to Die modlet installation](https://gist.github.com/doughphunghus/a1907c5f63b5fe79bd823965328f25bf)
